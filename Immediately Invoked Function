An immediately invoked function expression is a way to execute functions, as soon as they are executed.

Example:
(function () {

}())

Normal:
let num1 =10;
let num2= 20;

(function(add){
    console.log(num1+num2);
})()

Arrow:
let num1 =10;
let num2= 20;

((add) =>{
    console.log(num1+num2);
})()
