Example 1 :

var x; 
console.log(x);

Output : undefined 

if you try to use a variable that doesn't exist and has not been declared, then JavaScript will throw an error var 
name is not defined and the script will stop executing thereafter

Example 2 :

let h = 88 ;
console.log(f)

output : not defined
