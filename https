HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol used for transferring data over a network. two main kinds of HTTP messages: requests and responses,
HTTPS uses TLS (or SSL) to encrypt HTTP requests and responses,

TLS uses a technology called public key cryptography: there are two keys, a public key and a private key, and the public key is shared with client devices via the server's SSL certificate.
When a client opens a connection with a server, the two devices use the public and private key to agree on new keys, called session keys, to encrypt further communications between them.

All HTTP requests and responses are then encrypted with these session keys, so that anyone who intercepts communications can only see a random string of characters, not the plaintext.
